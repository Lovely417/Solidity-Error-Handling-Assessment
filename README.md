## Overview

The Eligibility smart contract is designed to manage and verify voting eligibility based on age. This contract uses Solidity's Error Handling by require, assert, and revert statements to enforce eligibility rules and includes logging for debugging purposes using Hardhat's console.log.

## Prerequisites
- Solidity: Version 0.8.25
- Hardhat: Ensure Hardhat is installed and properly configured in your development environment.

## Features
1. Set Age: Allows setting the age of a voter.
2. Eligibility Checks: Implements three different methods to check voting eligibility using assert, require, and revert statements.
3. Logging: Utilizes Hardhat's console.log for debugging and tracking state changes.
